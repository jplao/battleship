I have laid out my ships on the grid.
You now need to layout your two ships.
The first is two units long and the
second is three units long.
The grid has A1 at the top left and D4 at the bottom right.

Note that there are certain restrictions on where a ship can be placed.

Specifically:
Ships cannot wrap around the board
Ships cannot overlap
Ships can be laid either horizontally or vertically
Coordinates must correspond to the first and last units of the ship.
(IE: You can’t place a two unit ship at “A1 A3”)

Enter the squares for the two-unit ship:
