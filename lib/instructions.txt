Here are the instructions:

You and the computer each have two ships.
First, the computer will place their ships on the board.
Then, you will place your ships on the board.
Each player will then take turns guessing where the other player placed their ships.
The game will notify you if your guess was a hit or a miss.
And then the other player will take their turn, and so on.
The first player to hit and sink all of the other player's ships wins!

Happy hunting!
